Iâ€™m a <a href="https://www.aikesadvies.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freelance software developer</a> from the Netherlands. These days I build web applications with Ruby on Rails. Before that I was a Linux server administrator.

        When I was a sysadmin I sometimes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070209232211/http://www.debian-administration.org:80/articles/423" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>Â tutorials, I liked doing that. I recently noticed that a there are a lot of blogs about Ruby on Rails development but few about the challenges of running Rails in production. Setting up servers, monitoring, backups, etc.
      </p>

        I&#8217;ve started this blog to address that. Let me know if I missed something or you want me to write about something. You can DM me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/runrails">Twitter</a> or mail me at <a href="mailto:aike@runrails.com">aike@runrails.com</a>.

        This blog has it&#8217;s own twitter feedÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/runrails">@runrails</a>, that tweets when I post something new and when I see something interesting in the news.
